      <description>Some background This is a challenge from 0xl4ugh CTF which was inspired by RACTF&amp;rsquo;s not really ai challenge, It was the first ever pwn challenge I solve in a CTF alone and I really liked it hence I wanted to bring it to this CTF (you can even check my poorly written writeup for that challenge which I refuse to remove as It&amp;rsquo;s pretty awesome to look back and see how much did we grow).</description>

      <description>Little Background This is a Binary exploitaion challenge, based around a format string vulnerability.
 Misusage of the libc printf() function can lead to serious information leakage and even code execution. when we pass one argument (for example printf(foo)) we can:  leak stack addresses using %x or %p format specifiers. overwrite any pointer&amp;rsquo;s value using %n specifier (note that we can&amp;rsquo;t overwrite plain stack addresses as the %n format specifier can only overwrite by reference and not by value)    For more information on format strings please check this awesome resource</description>
