      <description>What is a Buffer anyway? We can think of buffers as containers to hold our data for later use, it&amp;rsquo;s not really something specific to computer science; In fact, we have buffers in electronics, mechanics, chemistry and even politics! We can say that the word buffer is just a fancy name for a placeholder (temporary storage)!
Buffer in Computer Science Now, it&amp;rsquo;s time to get more technical and get to know buffers more in computer science!</description>

      <description>To Linux or not to Linux Since a couple months ago, i have decided to try and switch fully to linux and ditch that piece of junk they call windows.
Now, that&amp;rsquo;s a bit misleading since i have been using windows for the past 12-13 years of my keyboard smashing journey but i don&amp;rsquo;t really feel any guilt doing this, in fact windows is nothing more of a bottleneck to me or so have i figured later.</description>

      <description>Recursion is a pretty improtant topic in programming and it&amp;rsquo;s not that hard to grasp or even implement, but how about actually using it correctly?
In this blog post i will try to explain the basic concept of recursion and then show why recursion can be so inefficient and how to optimize it using Call Tail Optimization!
Normal Recursion, A Factorial Example Most of us tech nerds have already dealt with the good &amp;lsquo;ol recursion, let&amp;rsquo;s refresh our understanding using the iconic factorial program.</description>

      <description>Little Background This is a Binary exploitaion challenge, based around a format string vulnerability.
 Misusage of the libc printf() function can lead to serious information leakage and even code execution. when we pass one argument (for example printf(foo)) we can:  leak stack addresses using %x or %p format specifiers. overwrite any pointer&amp;rsquo;s value using %n specifier (note that we can&amp;rsquo;t overwrite plain stack addresses as the %n format specifier can only overwrite by reference and not by value)    For more information on format strings please check this awesome resource</description>
