      <description>Some background This is a challenge from 0xl4ugh CTF which was inspired by RACTF&amp;rsquo;s not really ai challenge, It was the first ever pwn challenge I solve in a CTF alone and I really liked it hence I wanted to bring it to this CTF (you can even check my poorly written writeup for that challenge which I refuse to remove as It&amp;rsquo;s pretty awesome to look back and see how much did we grow).</description>
