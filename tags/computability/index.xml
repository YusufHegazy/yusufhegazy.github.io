      <description>Introduction In this series of blog posts, I will be discussing some of my favorite topics in math, It mostly falls under the domains of mathematical logic and computability theory.
Diophantus of Alexandria Diophantus was a Greek mathematician that flourished around 250 AD, he is most famous for his book &amp;ldquo;Arithmetica&amp;rdquo; in which he had compiled 130 algebraic problems among thirteen books where most of their solutions were positive integers, and that&amp;rsquo;s why mathematicians call such algebraic equations as &amp;ldquo;Diophantine Equations&amp;rdquo;.</description>
